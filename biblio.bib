  abstract = {A central problem of microstructure is to develop technologies capable of producing an arrangement, or ordering, of a polycrystalline material, in terms of mesoscopic parameters, like geometry and crystallography, appropriate for a given application. Is there such an order in the first place? Our goal is to describe the emergence of the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD), a statistic that details texture evolution discovered recently, and to illustrate why it should be considered a material property. For the GBCD statistic, we have developed a theory that relies on mass transport and entropy. The focus of this paper is its identification as a gradient flow in the sense of De Giorgi, as illustrated by Ambrosio, Gigli, and Savare\textasciiacute. In this way, the empirical texture statistic is revealed as a solution of a Fokker\textendash Planck type equation whose evolution is determined by weak topology kinetics and whose limit behavior is a Boltzmann distribution. The identification as a gradient flow by our method is tantamount to exhibiting the harvested statistic as the iterates in a JKO implicit scheme. This requires several new ideas. The development exposes the question of how to understand the circumstances under which a harvested empirical statistic is a property of the underlying process.},

The algorithm is built on tools from computational geometry and optimal transport theory which, as far as we are aware, have not been applied to microstructure modelling before. We illustrate the speed and accuracy of the algorithm by generating RVEs with user-defined volume distributions with up to 20,000 grains in 3D.

This class of unbalanced transport metrics allows for transport between measures of different total mass, unlike classical optimal transport where both measures must have the same total mass. In particular, we develop the theory for the important subclass of semi-discrete unbalanced transport problems, where one of the measures is diffuse (absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure) and the other is discrete (a sum of Dirac masses). We characterize the optimal solutions and show they can be written in terms of generalized Laguerre diagrams. We use this to develop an efficient method for solving the semi-discrete unbalanced transport problem numerically. As an application we study the unbalanced quantization problem, where one looks for the best approximation of a diffuse measure by a discrete measure with respect to an unbalanced transport metric. We prove a type of crystallization result in two dimensions \textendash{} optimality of the triangular lattice \textendash and compute the asymptotic quantization error as the number of Dirac masses tends to infinity.},

  abstract = {Comparing probability distributions is a fundamental problem in data sciences. Simple norms and divergences such as the total variation and the relative entropy only compare densities in a point-wise manner and fail to capture the geometric nature of the problem. In sharp contrast, Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) and Optimal Transport distances (OT) are two classes of distances between measures that take into account the geometry of the underlying space and metrize the convergence in law.  This paper studies the Sinkhorn divergences, a family of geometric divergences that interpolates between MMD and OT. Relying on a new notion of geometric entropy, we provide theoretical guarantees for these divergences: positivity, convexity and metrization of the convergence in law. On the practical side, we detail a numerical scheme that enables the large scale application of these divergences for machine learning: on the GPU, gradients of the Sinkhorn loss can be computed for batches of a million samples.},

  abstract = {The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold endowed with the L2 metric acting on the space of probability densities gives a unifying framework for the incompressible Euler equation and the theory of optimal mass transport. Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport to the space of positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural extension of the classical L2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a similar relation between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv right-invariant metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. Geometrically, we present an isometric embedding of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this right-invariant metric in the automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed with an L2 type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH equation as a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms group; On S1, solutions to the standard CH thus give radially 1-homogeneous solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on R2 which preserves a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application consists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the Hdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently short times.},

The dissipative counterpart of such a system coincides with the porous medium equation, which can be cast in the form of a gradient flow for the same internal energy. Motivated by these related variational structures, we propose a particle method for both problems in which the internal energy is replaced by its Moreau-Yosida regularization in the L2 sense, which can be efficiently computed as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Using a modulated energy argument which exploits the convexity of the problem in Eulerian variables, we prove quantitative convergence estimates towards smooth solutions. We verify such estimates by means of several numerical tests.},

The formal geodesic equations for this problem are Euler equations for incompressible, inviscid potential flow of fluid with zero pressure and surface tension on the free boundary. The problem of minimizing this action exhibits an instability associated with microdroplet formation, with the following outcomes: any two shapes of equal volume can be approximately connected by an Euler spray\textemdash a countable superposition of ellipsoidal geodesics. The infimum of the action is the Wasserstein distance squared, and is almost never attained except in dimension 1. Every Wasserstein geodesic between bounded densities of compact support provides a solution of the (compressible) pressureless Euler system that is a weak limit of (incompressible) Euler sprays.},

A common way to do so relies on the construction of a uniform probability distribution over a set of N points which minimizes the Wasserstein distance to the model distribution. This minimization problem, where the unknowns are the positions of the atoms, is non-convex. Yet, in most cases, a suitably adjusted version of Lloyd's algorithm \textemdash in which Voronoi cells are replaced by Power cells \textemdash{} leads to configurations with small Wasserstein error. This is surprising because, again, of the non-convex nature of the problem, as well as the existence of spurious critical points. We provide explicit upper bounds for the convergence speed of this Lloyd-type algorithm, starting from a cloud of points sufficiently far from each other. This already works after one step of the iteration procedure, and similar bounds can be deduced, for the corresponding gradient descent. These bounds naturally lead to a modified Poliak-\L ojasiewicz inequality for the Wasserstein distance cost, with an error term depending on the distances between Dirac masses in the discrete distribution.},
