  abstract = {The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold endowed with the L2 metric acting on the space of probability densities gives a unifying framework for the incompressible Euler equation and the theory of optimal mass transport. Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport to the space of positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural extension of the classical L2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a similar relation between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv right-invariant metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. Geometrically, we present an isometric embedding of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this right-invariant metric in the automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed with an L2 type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH equation as a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms group; On S1, solutions to the standard CH thus give radially 1-homogeneous solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on R2 which preserves a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application consists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the Hdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently short times.},

  abstract = {When expressed in Lagrangian variables, the equations of motion for compressible (barotropic) fluids have the structure of a classical Hamiltonian system in which the potential energy is given by the internal energy of the fluid. The dissipative counterpart of such a system coincides with the porous medium equation, which can be cast in the form of a gradient flow for the same internal energy. Motivated by these related variational structures, we propose a particle method for both problems in which the internal energy is replaced by its Moreau-Yosida regularization in the L2 sense, which can be efficiently computed as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Using a modulated energy argument which exploits the convexity of the problem in Eulerian variables, we prove quantitative convergence estimates towards smooth solutions. We verify such estimates by means of several numerical tests.},

  abstract = {We study a model of crowd motion following a gradient vector field, with possibly additional interaction terms such as attraction/repulsion, and we present a numerical scheme for its solution through a Lagrangian discretization. The density constraint of the resulting particles is enforced by means of a partial optimal transport problem at each time step. We prove the convergence of the discrete measures to a solution of the continuous PDE describing the crowd motion in dimension one. In a second part, we show how a similar approach can be used to construct a Lagrangian discretization of a linear advection-diffusion equation. Both discretizations rely on the interpretation of the two equations (crowd motion and linear diffusion) as gradient flows in Wasserstein space. We provide also a numerical implementation in 2D to demonstrate the feasibility of the computations.},
