  abstract = {A central problem of microstructure is to develop technologies capable of producing an arrangement, or ordering, of a polycrystalline material, in terms of mesoscopic parameters, like geometry and crystallography, appropriate for a given application. Is there such an order in the first place? Our goal is to describe the emergence of the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD), a statistic that details texture evolution discovered recently, and to illustrate why it should be considered a material property. For the GBCD statistic, we have developed a theory that relies on mass transport and entropy. The focus of this paper is its identification as a gradient flow in the sense of De Giorgi, as illustrated by Ambrosio, Gigli, and Savare\textasciiacute. In this way, the empirical texture statistic is revealed as a solution of a Fokker\textendash Planck type equation whose evolution is determined by weak topology kinetics and whose limit behavior is a Boltzmann distribution. The identification as a gradient flow by our method is tantamount to exhibiting the harvested statistic as the iterates in a JKO implicit scheme. This requires several new ideas. The development exposes the question of how to understand the circumstances under which a harvested empirical statistic is a property of the underlying process.},

  abstract = {The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold endowed with the L2 metric acting on the space of probability densities gives a unifying framework for the incompressible Euler equation and the theory of optimal mass transport. Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport to the space of positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural extension of the classical L2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a similar relation between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv right-invariant metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. Geometrically, we present an isometric embedding of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this right-invariant metric in the automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed with an L2 type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH equation as a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms group; On S1, solutions to the standard CH thus give radially 1-homogeneous solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on R2 which preserves a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application consists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the Hdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently short times.},

  abstract = {When expressed in Lagrangian variables, the equations of motion for compressible (barotropic) fluids have the structure of a classical Hamiltonian system in which the potential energy is given by the internal energy of the fluid. The dissipative counterpart of such a system coincides with the porous medium equation, which can be cast in the form of a gradient flow for the same internal energy. Motivated by these related variational structures, we propose a particle method for both problems in which the internal energy is replaced by its Moreau-Yosida regularization in the L2 sense, which can be efficiently computed as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Using a modulated energy argument which exploits the convexity of the problem in Eulerian variables, we prove quantitative convergence estimates towards smooth solutions. We verify such estimates by means of several numerical tests.},

Our approach combines Arnold's interpretation of the solution of the Euler equations for incompressible and inviscid fluids as geodesics in the space of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms, and an extrinsic approximation of the equations of geodesics due to Brenier. Using recently developed semi-discrete optimal transport solvers, this approach yields a numerical scheme which is able to handle problems of realistic size in 2D. Our purpose in this article is to establish the convergence of this scheme towards regular solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, and to provide numerical experiments on a few simple test cases in 2D.},

The density constraint of the resulting particles is enforced by means of a partial optimal transport problem at each time step. We prove the convergence of the discrete measures to a solution of the continuous PDE describing the crowd motion in dimension one. In a second part, we show how a similar approach can be used to construct a Lagrangian discretization of a linear advection-diffusion equation. Both discretizations rely on the interpretation of the two equations (crowd motion and linear diffusion) as gradient flows in Wasserstein space. We provide also a numerical implementation in 2D to demonstrate the feasibility of the computations.},

  abstract = {As V. I. Arnold observed in the 1960s, the Euler equations of incompressible fluid flow correspond formally to geodesic equations in a group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. Working in an Eulerian framework, we study incompressible flows of shapes as critical paths for action (kinetic energy) along transport paths constrained to have characteristic-function densities. The formal geodesic equations for this problem are Euler equations for incompressible, inviscid potential flow of fluid with zero pressure and surface tension on the free boundary. The problem of minimizing this action exhibits an instability associated with microdroplet formation, with the following outcomes: any two shapes of equal volume can be approximately connected by an Euler spray\textemdash a countable superposition of ellipsoidal geodesics. The infimum of the action is the Wasserstein distance squared, and is almost never attained except in dimension 1. Every Wasserstein geodesic between bounded densities of compact support provides a solution of the (compressible) pressureless Euler system that is a weak limit of (incompressible) Euler sprays.},
