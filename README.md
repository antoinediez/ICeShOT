# Incompressible Cell Shapes via Optimal Transport

This repository contains the source code and script files for the article 

A. Diez, J. Feydy, *An optimal transport approach to model dynamical shapes, collective motion and cellular aggregates*, preprint, 2024

The `scripts` folder contains the Python files to reproduce the numerical experiments shown in the article. The associated supplementary videos can be found in [this Figshare folder](https://figshare.com/s/9d4511782ed00aaa6b48).

The documentation is still in progres...
